# Starting The Robot
If you changed code, see [Editing and Deploying Code](/editing-code)
## The Robot
1. Get the robot that you are trying to launch. Also get a battery (2023 ones).
2. Plug the battery into the robot and flip the switch to connect the current.
## Running Code
1. If you are reading this, you probably already got a computer with the code on it. If not, find either CC1, CC2, or the other Dell laptop (not CAD laptop).
2. Get the controllers listed in the robot's Controller Bindings page (docs.longmetal.org) and plug it into one of the USB slots in the computer.
3. If it isn't already open, open Driver Station from the Windows Start Menu. You can look this up by pressing the Windows button in the buttom right. 
4. Open the :material-steering: tab within the driver station. Within that tab there should be an Enable and Disable switch. When enabled, the robot can move, and vice versa for when it's disabled. 
5. After making sure no one is nearby, enable the code, and you will be driving a fully functioning robot! If not, there's probably a bug somewhere or you forgot to do something.
## Turning Off the Robot
1. In the code, press disable to turn off the code, so you won't get hurt accidentally turning off the robot.
2. Press the red button on the robot to turn it off. Then put back all the materials you took out.

!!! warning
    Sometimes the controller will recognize inputs but not move the robot after enabling the code. One reason for this is that the computer may be recognizing the wrong USB slot for the controller. If this is true, then navigate to the :material-usb: tab in the Drive Station. Within there, make sure your controller (the one flashing green after you press a button) is in the correct slot. Any other slot will not work. The correct controller bindings for each slot are documented in the robot's Controller Bindings page. The icon of the controller currently plugged in will be green, drag this to the position correlating with the number specified in the docs for the robot you are trying to run.
