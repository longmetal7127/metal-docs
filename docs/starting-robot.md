# Starting The Robot
If you changed code, see [Editing and Deploying Code](/editing-code)
## Running Code
1. If it isn't already open, open Driver Station from the Windows Start Menu. You can look this up by pressing the Windows button in the buttom right. 
2. Open the :material-steering: tab within the driver station. Within that tab there should be an Enable and Disable switch. When enabled, the robot can move, and vice versa for when it's disabled. 
3. After making sure no one is nearby, enable the code, and you will be driving a fully functioning robot! If not, there's probably a bug somewhere or you forgot to do something.

!!! warning
    Sometimes the controller will recognize inputs but not move the robot after enabling the code. One reason for this is that the computer may be recognizing the wrong USB slot for the controller. If this is true, then navigate to the :material-usb: tab in the Drive Station. Within there, make sure your controller (the one flashing green after you press a button) is in the correct slot. Any other slot will not work. The correct controller bindings for each slot are documented in the robot's Controller Bindings page.
